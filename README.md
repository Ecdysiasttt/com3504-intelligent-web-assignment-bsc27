## Brief Description of the Project:
<p>Welcome to PLANTPEDIA! This is a progressive web application for plant recognition. </p>
<br>Developed as a COM3504 Project, we aim to provide a convenient tool for users to record the details of the plants they have seen in an organised way, and also to look up details of plants more easily.</br>
<p>We also want to build up a community for plant lovers by allowing convenient interactions between plant viewers by chats and comments.</p>
